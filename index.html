    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease an 8-inch round cake pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 ½ cups flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 ½ tsp baking powder, and ¼ tsp salt. In a large bowl, beat ½ cup softened butter until creamy, then add the sugar and beat until fluffy. Mix in 2 eggs one at a time, followed by 1 tsp vanilla extract. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients alternating with ½ cup milk until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
